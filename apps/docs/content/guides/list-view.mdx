# List Views

Resources list views are the main entry point for your resources. They allow you to view, filter, and sort your data. You can also create, edit, and delete records.

To declare a list view, you need to provide the `list` to your resource `page` property:

```tsx
{
  pages: {
    list: {
      columns: [
        { accessorKey: 'id', header: 'ID', enableColumnFilter: false },
        { accessorKey: 'title', header: 'Title', filterFn: 'includesString' },
      ],
      loader: async () => {
        const posts = await fetchPosts();
        return { data: posts };
      },
    }
  }
}
```

`columns` property is a definition a data table. Data tables is based on [tanstack-table](https://react-table.tanstack.com/). You can find more information about allowed configurations in the [official documentation](https://react-table.tanstack.com/docs/overview).

`loader` property is a function that fetches data from your backend. It should return an object with a `data` property that contains the data you want to display.
The loader might be implemented as a NextJS server-side function and can fetch data from any sources, such as REST, GraphQL, Prisma, Drizzle, etc.
