# New Resource Views

To allow users to create a new instances of the resource you need to provide a `new` page to your resource `pages` property.
It is pretty similar to the `edit` page. But you don't need to define a loader

```tsx
{
  pages: {
    new: {
      schema: z.object({
        title: z.string(),
      }),
      actions: {
        submit: async (data) => {
          await createPost(data);
        },
      },
    }
  }
}
```

The rest of functionality is the same as for the `edit` page.
